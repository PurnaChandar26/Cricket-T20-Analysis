Introduction
------------

Cricket T20 Analysis is a project focused on processing and analyzing T20 World Cup cricket data. The project involves extracting data from JSON files related to match results, batting summaries, bowling summaries, and players' information. The extracted data is then transformed, cleaned, and organized into structured CSV files, making it suitable for further analysis.

Data Sources
------------

The project uses JSON files as the data source, containing information about T20 World Cup cricket matches, players' performances, and more. The data is sourced from various T20 cricket matches.

Data Preprocessing
------------------

The data preprocessing pipeline involves several steps:

1.  Match Results Processing: Match results data is extracted from JSON files, and relevant information such as team names, winners, and match IDs are organized into a DataFrame. This information is crucial for linking with other tables.

2.  Batting Summary Processing: Batting summary data is extracted from JSON files, and relevant information about batsmen's performances is organized into a DataFrame. Information about runs, balls faced, boundaries, and dismissal status are included.

3.  Bowling Summary Processing: Bowling summary data is extracted from JSON files, and relevant information about bowlers' performances is organized into a DataFrame. Details such as overs, runs conceded, wickets taken, and economy rate are included.

4.  Players Information Processing: Players' information data is extracted from JSON files and organized into a DataFrame. This includes details about players' names, teams, batting styles, bowling styles, playing roles, and descriptions.

Features
--------

-   Structured Data: The project provides clean and structured CSV files containing match results, batting summaries, bowling summaries, and players' information.
-   Insightful Analysis: Analysts and cricket enthusiasts can perform various analyses using the provided data, gaining insights into player performances, team dynamics, and match statistics.
-   Data Exploration: Explore T20 cricket data to answer questions about players' form, teams' strategies, and match outcomes.

Getting Started
